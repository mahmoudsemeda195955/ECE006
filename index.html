<br><b>Definition</b><br/>
<br> <br/>
<b>Cryptography</b> is the science of using mathematics to encrypt and decrypt data,<b>Phil Zimmermann</b><br/>
<br><b>Cryptography</b> is the art and science of keeping messages secure,<b>Bruce Schneier</b>
</br>
<br>The art and science of concealing the messages to introduce secrecy in information
security is recognized as cryptography.
<br/>
<br> <br/>
<br><b>Terminology</b><br/>

<br>A message is plaintext (sometimes called cleartext). The process of disguising a message in such a way as to hide its substance is encryption. An encrypted message is ciphertext. The process of turning ciphertext back into plaintext is decryption.
<br/>
<br>A cipher (or cypher) is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryptionâ€”a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure.
<br/>

<br>While cryptography is the science of securing data, cryptanalysis is the science of analyzing and breaking secure communication. Classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of analytical reasoning, application of mathematical tools, pattern finding, patience, determination,and luck. Cryptanalysts are also called attackers.<br/>
<br>Cryptology embraces both cryptography and cryptanalysis.<br/>

<br>A cryptosystem is an implementation of cryptographic techniques and their accompanying infrastructure to provide information security services. A cryptosystem is also referred to as a cipher system. The various
components of a basic cryptosystem are as follows <br/>
<li>Plaintext</li>
<li>Encryption Algorithm</li>
<li>Ciphertext</li>
<li>Decryption Algorithm</li>
<li>Encryption Key</li>
<li>Decryption Key</li>
