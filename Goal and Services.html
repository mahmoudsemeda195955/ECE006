<br><b>Goal and Services</b></br>
<br><b>Goal:</b> The primary goal of cryptography is to secure important data on the hard disk or
as it passes through a medium that may not be secure itself. Usually, that medium is a
computer network.</br>
<br><b>Services: </b>Cryptography can provide the following services:</br>
<ul><li>Confidentiality (secrecy) </li>
<li>Integrity (anti-tampering)</li>
<li>Authentication</li>
<li>Non-repudiation.</li></ul>

<br><b>Confidentiality (secrecy) </b></br>
<ul><li>Ensuring that no one can read the message except the intended receiver</li>
<li>Data is kept secret from those without the proper credentials, even if
that data travels through an insecure medium</li></ul>

<br><b>Integrity (anti-tampering)</b></br>
<ul><li>Assuring the receiver that the received message has not been altered in
any way from the original.</li></ul>

<br><b>Authentication</b></br>
<br>Cryptography can help establish identity for authentication purposes
The process of proving one's identity. (The primary forms of host-to-host
authentication on the Internet today are name-based or address-based,
both of which are notoriously weak.) </br>

<br><b>Non-repudiation</b></br>
<br>A mechanism to prove that the sender really sent this message</br>
