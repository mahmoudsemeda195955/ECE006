<br><b>Types of Cryptography</b><br/>
<br> <br/>
<br><b>Symmetric Key Cryptography</b></br>
<br> Also known as Secret Key Cryptography or Conventional Cryptography, Symmetric Key Cryptography is an encryption system in which the sender and receiver of a message share a
single,common key that is used to encrypt and decrypt the message. <br/>
<br>The Algorithm use is also known as a secret key algorithm or sometimes called a symmetric algorithm
</br>
<br>A key is a piece of information (a parameter) that determines the functional output of a cryptographic algorithm or cipher.</br>
<br>The key for encrypting and decrypting the file had to be known to all the recipients. Else, the message
could not be decrypted by conventional means.

    <td><b>Data Encryption Standard (DES)</b></td>
	<td>The Data Encryption Standard was published in 1977 by the US National Bureau of Standards.
DES uses a 56 bit key and maps a 64 bit input block of plaintext onto a 64 bit output block of ciphertext. 56
bits is a rather small key for today's computing power.</td>

	<td>Triple DES was the answer to many of the shortcomings of DES. Since it is based on the DES algorithm, it is
very easy to modify existing software to use Triple DES. It also has the advantage of proven reliability and a
longer key length that eliminates many of the shortcut attacks that can be used to reduce the amount of
time it takes to break DES.</td>

    <td><b>Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) </b></td>
	<td>Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is an encryption standard adopted by the U.S. government. The
standard comprises three block ciphers, AES-128, AES-192 and AES-256, adopted from a larger collection
originally published as Rijndael.
Each AES cipher has a 128-bit block size, with key sizes of 128, 192 and 256 bits, respectively. The AES
ciphers have been analyzed extensively and are now used worldwide, as was the case with its
predecessor, the Data Encryption Standard (DES).</td>

    <td><b>IDEA</b></td>
	<td>The International Data Encryption Algorithm was developed in 1991.
It uses a 128 bit key to encrypt a 64 bit block of plaintext into a 64 bit block of ciphertext.
IDEA's general structure is very similar to DES, it performs 17 rounds, each round taking 64 bits of
input to produce a 64 bit output, using per-round keys generated from the 128 bit key. </td>

<br><b>Asymmetric Key Cryptography</b></br>
<br>Asymmetric cryptography , also known as Public-key cryptography, refers to a cryptographic algorithm which
requires two separate keys, one of which is private and one of which is public. The public key is used to
encrypt the message and the private one is used to decrypt the message. <br/>
<br>Public Key Cryptography is a very advanced form of cryptography.
Officially, it was invented by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1975.
</br>
<br>The basic technique of public key cryptography was first discovered in 1973 by the British Clifford Cocks of
Communications-Electronics Security Group (CESG) of (Government Communications Headquarters - GCHQ)
but this was a secret until 1997.</br>

Agency (NSA) to generate a digital signature for the authentication of electronic documents. DSS was put forth
by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 1994, and has become the United States
government standard for authentication of electronic documents. DSS is specified in Federal Information
Processing Standard (FIPS) 186.</td>

	<td>RSA (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman who first publicly described it in 1977) is an algorithm for public-key
cryptography. It is the first algorithm known to be suitable for signing as well as encryption, and one of
the first great advances in public key cryptography.
RSA is widely used in electronic commerce protocols, and is believed to be secure given sufficiently long
keys and the use of up-to-date implementations.</td>

<br><b>What is a Hash Function?</b></br>
<br>A cryptographic hash function is a hash function that
takes an arbitrary block of data and returns a fixed-size
bit string, the cryptographic hash value, such that any
(accidental or intentional) change to the data will (with
very high probability) change the hash value. The data
to be encoded are often called the message, and the
hash value is sometimes called the message digest or
simply digest.
<br/>
<br>The ideal cryptographic hash function has four main properties:
</br>
<li>it is easy to compute the hash value for any given message</li>
<li>it is infeasible to generate a message that has a given hash</li>
<li>it is infeasible to modify a message without changing the hash</li>
<li>it is infeasible to find two different messages with the same hash.</li>

	<td>The Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) hash functions are a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by
the National Security Agency (NSA) and published by the NIST as a U.S. Federal Information Processing
Standard. .
• SHA stands for Secure Hash Algorithm.
• Because of the successful attacks on MD5, SHA-0 and theoretical attacks on SHA-1, NIST
perceived a need for an alternative, dissimilar cryptographic hash, which became SHA-3.
• In October 2012, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) chose the Keccak
algorithm as the new SHA-3 standard.</td>
