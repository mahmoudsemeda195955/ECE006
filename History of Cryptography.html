<br><b>History of Cryptography</b>
<br/>
<br>  </br>
<br>As civilizations evolved, human beings got organized in tribes, groups, and kingdoms.
This led to the emergence of ideas such as power, battles, supremacy, and politics.
These ideas further fueled the natural need of people to communicate secretly with selective recipient which
in turn ensured the continuous evolution of cryptography as well.
<br/>
<br>The roots of cryptography are found in Roman and Egyptian civilizations.
</br>
<br><b>Hieroglyph</b></br>
<br>The first known evidence of cryptography can be traced to the use of ‘hieroglyph’. Some 4000 years ago, the
Egyptians used to communicate by messages written in hieroglyph.</br>
<br><b>Caesar Shift Cipher</b></br>
<br>Caesar Shift Cipher, relies on shifting the letters of a message by an agreed number (three was a common choice), the recipient of this message would then shift the letters back by the same
number and obtain the original message.</br>
<br>The Caesar cipher is named after Julius Caesar , who used it with
a shift of three to protect messages of military significance.</br>
